# Decline button

Taken from an underwriting application.

The decline button should be used as it's own self-contained component.  It will take care of enabling/disabling itself based on case declinability.  It will also take care of rendering modals and dialogs as needed through the decline process.

Many of the hooks have been broken up into smaller hooks to facilitate unit testing.
