# code-samples
Code samples pulled from various projects - Without context they mean nothing to you!

- These were pulled from currently active projects
- Having these here doesn't violate my contractual agreements
- I removed any context tieing them to the company/project I pulled them from
- they are fully of my design (stuff I've built)
- They are unaltered (for the most part).  I may have added some documentation in a couple places explaining what I did but otherwise I left any mistakes in there.  I'm sure, if I had the time, I would go back and refactor bits based on better patterns I've learned. 

Demonstrates:

- Basic react compentency
- use of react hooks
- Preference of custom hooks in situations
- Complicated javascript data mapping
- Unit testing style
- Documentation style (where apt)
- propensity for talking to oneself
